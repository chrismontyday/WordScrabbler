# WordScrabbler

Run as a Java Project. It is a simple(and silly) command-line program that acts exactly the same as MadLibs.

First it will ask you for a number. That will be how many times it will ask you for a noun and then an adjective.

Each time you type in both a noun then an adjective it then scrambles every answer you've put in and creates random sentences with the words. 

Made this in my break time at school just for fun.
